# 🔒 SafeBlur AI

**SafeBlur AI** is a deep learning-based computer vision system designed to automatically detect and blur sensitive or inappropriate content in images. This tool is particularly useful for content moderation on social media platforms, parental control, educational tools, or secure media sharing.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Automatic face and object detection  
- ✅ Selective blurring of sensitive areas  
- ✅ Fast inference with pre-trained models  
- ✅ Easy-to-use Python interface

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedAyman77/SafeBlur_AI.git
cd SafeBlur_AI
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the App

Run the main script to start detection and blurring:

```bash
python main.py
```

> You may need to modify `main.py` to set the input image path.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Loads the input image.
2. Uses deep learning models to detect sensitive content like faces, nudity, etc.
3. Applies a blur filter (e.g., Gaussian) to the detected regions.
4. Saves or displays the safe version of the media.
